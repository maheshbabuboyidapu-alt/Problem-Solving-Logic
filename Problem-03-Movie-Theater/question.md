# Problem 03 — Movie Theater Ticket Pricing

## Problem Statement

Calculate the final price for a movie theater booking. The price is calculated per ticket and then multiplied by the number of tickets.

## Rules

### Age-based base price

- Child (1–12): ₹150.
- Teen (13–17): ₹200.
- Adult (18–60): ₹300.
- Senior (61+): ₹200.

### Show-time adjustment

Applied to the base price:

- Matinee (10:00–16:59): −₹50.
- Evening (17:00–20:59): +₹100.
- Night (21:00–23:59): +₹150.
- Times outside these ranges receive no time adjustment.

### Group discount

Applied to the price after the time adjustment:

- Fewer than 5 tickets: 0%.
- 5–9 tickets: 10%.
- 10–19 tickets: 15%.
- 20 or more tickets: 20%.

### Membership discount

Applied after the group discount:

- Member: 5%.
- Non-member: 0%.
