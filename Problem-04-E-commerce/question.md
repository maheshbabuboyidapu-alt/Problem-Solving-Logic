After category discount: ₹7600.00
Bonus discount: 10% = ₹760.00
After bonus discount: ₹6840.00
Shipping: Free

Final: ₹6740.00
```

### Test Case 2 — Groceries, small amount, shipping applies

amount = 400
coupon = NONE
```

**Expected Output**

Category discount: None
Bonus discount: None
Shipping: ₹100.00

Final: ₹500.00
```

### Test Case 3 — Clothing, large order, no coupon

**Input**

coupon = NONE
```

**Expected Output**

### Test Case 4 — Boundary: category discount leaves an amount inside the bonus tier

**Input**
```text
category = Books
amount = 1112
coupon = SAVE10
```

**Expected Output**
```text
Category discount: 10% = ₹111.20
After category discount: ₹1000.80
Bonus discount: 5% = ₹50.04
After bonus discount: ₹950.76
Shipping: ₹50.00
